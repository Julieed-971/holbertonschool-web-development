In this project, we are asked to create an HTML from a wireframe using a figma file as instructions.
Please take a look at how I twisted the instruction of this project just for the fun

In this project, we are asked to create the CSS styling of the HTML page of the previous project.
Using the indication provided by the figma file, I recreated the style as close as possible, the result is however not responsive.
