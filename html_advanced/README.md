<p>
In this and coming projects, you will implement from scratch a webpage from a designer file.

For this first project, you will focus on the HTML structure only - no CSS, no style - just pure HTML semantic.

This designer file will be available on Figma - feel free to create an account to access the final result here:

* Page in Figma
* fig file

<img src="../images/0.png" width="250px">

Important notes with Figma:

* if your computer doesn’t have missing fonts, you can find them here: `source-sans-pro` and `Spin-Cycle-OT`
* some values are in float - feel free to round them

For this task, please write an amazing `README.md`

And “Duplicate to your Drafts” to have access to all design details.
